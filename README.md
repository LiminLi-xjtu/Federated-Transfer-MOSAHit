# Federated-Transfer-MOSAHit
Federated transfer learning with differential privacy for multi-omics survival analysis
MOSAHit method, trained using federated transfer learning, enables the learning of a more robust multi-omics survival prediction model for a local target cancer with limited training data by effectively leveraging multi-omics data of related cancers distributed across multiple institutions, while preserving individual privacy.
